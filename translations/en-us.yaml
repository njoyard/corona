    headline: Writing series expressions
    intro: |
      A series expression is an arithmetic expression that is made of numbers like <code>-3.14</code>, field names like
      <code>confirmed</code>, or function calls like <code>change(deceased)</code>. Function arguments are also expressions,
      as such calls may be nested, as in <code>coalesce(-confirmed, 1 + (change(tests - deceased) * 20) / 3)</code>. Any whitespace
      is ignored and priority rules work as usual (use parentheses if needed).
    fields: 'The following field names are available, some of them not in all zones:'
    funcs: 'The following functions are available:'
    coalesce: returns the first expression that has a value
    change: returns the change of the expression compared to the previous day, has no value when the current or previous days don't
    weekly: returns the 7-day moving average of the expression, centered around the current day, and excluding missing values
    accumulate: accumulates values over time
    nonzero: excludes points where expression is zero
    lag: returns the value <code><i>expr</i></code> had <code><i>days</i></code> days before
  not-previewable: 'Cannot render preview graph, no valid series defined.'
